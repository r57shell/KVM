Only two scripts that are currently functioning:

- provisioner.pl
- provisioner-batch.sh

The first script allows you to create new VMs provided there is a master image and a master config file present.

Scripts and ideas in progress:

- Delete guests. Included as function of provisioner.pl script.
- Get IP address of guest. Included as function of provisioner.pl script. 
- Guest autoconfigures hostname by querying a database.
